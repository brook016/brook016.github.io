   	  <p> I’m Li Xi, a industrial designer in China.
        Last ten years, I have designed many products, however, most of them were for clients.
        One day, I realized, I need to design something for myself.
        Then I decided to become a maker.
        Now, I ‘m the design partner of a very cool company, Microduino.
        We make open source hardware for makers all over the world.
        We hope that, with our product everyone could bring their ideas to life. </p>
